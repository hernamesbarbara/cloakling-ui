When the user drags a document into the dropzone, it should create a new Document instance. 

Validate that the type of file is a PDF. For files other than PDFs, display a friendly error message. 

For PDFs, add the new Document to the left sidebar file and directory explorer as a clickable item. 

When a user clicks on a Document in the left sidebar, display the PDF using the `react-pdf` node package that we have already installed in our vite project.
