Create the main layout for this new web app. The web app is called Cloakling. 

The layout should be a two column layout. 

The left column should be a collapsable file and directory explorer tree. 

The right column should be a main content area. 

The main page container needs a max width of 1280. 

The left sidebar should have a default width equal to 250. 

The user should be able to click an icon to toggle expand/collapse the sidebar. 

The right column should dispaly a dropzone to upload a file by default. 

The dropzone does not need to do anything yet. We will work on that later on. 

The left column should display placeholder text "You have 0 documents"
